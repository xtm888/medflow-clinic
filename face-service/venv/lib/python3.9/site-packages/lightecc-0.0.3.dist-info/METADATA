LightECC is a lightweight elliptic curve cryptography library for its arithmetic for python. It is a hybrid library wrapping many elliptic curve forms such as [Weierstrass](https://sefiks.com/2016/03/13/the-math-behind-elliptic-curve-cryptography/), [Koblitz](https://sefiks.com/2016/03/13/the-math-behind-elliptic-curves-over-binary-field/) and [Edwards](https://sefiks.com/2018/12/19/a-gentle-introduction-to-edwards-curves/), and many pre-defined curves for those forms. LightECC simplifies these arithmetic operations. You don't need to understand the underlying principles forms. Once you define an elliptic curve in a given form, you can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of points using standard operators.

# Installation [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/lightecc.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/lightecc/)

The easiest way to install the LightECC package is to install it from python package index (PyPI).

```shell
pip install lightecc
```

Then you will be able to import the library and use its functionalities.

```python
from lightecc import LightECC
```

# Elliptic Curve Arithmetic

Building an elliptic curve cryptosystem is very straightforward in LightECC. You basically need to initialize a LightECC object with a form name and a curve name. By default, it constructs elliptic curves in Weierstras form.After that, you can retrieve the base point of the curve and perform various elliptic curve arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

```python
from lightecc import LightECC

# build an elliptic curve
ec = LightECC(
    form_name = "edwards", # or weierstrass, koblitz. default is weierstrass.
    curve_name = "ed25519", # check out supported curves section
)

# get the base point
G = ec.G

# addition
_2G = G + G
_3G = _2G + G
_5G = _3G + _2G
_10G = _5G + _5G

# subtraction
_9G = _10G - G

# multiplication
_20G = 20 * G
_50G = 50 * G

# division
_25G = _50G / G
```

Here, addition and subtraction require only basic formulas and can be performed in constant time 𝒪(1).

Supportingly, the [double-and-add](https://sefiks.com/2016/03/27/double-and-add-method/) method is adopted for multiplication, allowing it to be performed very quickly in linear time with 𝒪(log(n)), regardless of the size of the multiplier.

On the other hand, division requires solving the [elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem](https://sefiks.com/2018/02/28/attacking-elliptic-curve-discrete-logarithm-problem/), which is computationally difficult. Its time complexity is 𝒪(n) with brute force.

# Point at Infinity or Neutral & Identity Element

The order of the elliptic curve is defined by the argument n in the constructed LightECC object. This represents the total number of points on the curve. It also serves as the [neutral or identity element](https://sefiks.com/2023/09/29/understanding-identity-element-in-elliptic-curves/) in Edwards curves and point at infinity in Weierstass and Koblitz forms, meaning that adding this point to any other point does not change the result. Additionally, elliptic curves exhibit cyclic group properties beyond this point.

```python
ec = LightECC()

# order of elliptic curve
n = ec.n

# neutral element
neutral = n * G

# scalar multiplication
_17G = 17 * G
minus17G = -1 * _17G

# proof of work for neutralism
assert _17G == _17G + neutral
assert _17G + minus17G == neutral

# proof of work for cyclic group
assert (n + 1) * G == G
assert (n + 2) * G == 2 * G
```

# Supported Curves

Below is a list of elliptic curves supported by LightECC. Each curve has a specific order (n), which defines the number of points in the finite field. The order directly impacts the cryptosystem's security strength. A higher order typically corresponds to a stronger cryptosystem, making it more resistant to cryptographic attacks.

# Applications

With ECC, we can perform key exchange, digital signatures, and encryption. Explore the [`LightPHE`](https://github.com/serengil/LightPHE) library for its encryption and decryption implementation, which also demonstrates additive homomorphic properties. Additionally, check out [`LightDSA`](https://github.com/serengil/LightDSA) for digital signature implementations. These are both built on LightECC's fundamentals.

# Contributing

All PRs are more than welcome! If you are planning to contribute a large patch, please create an issue first to get any upfront questions or design decisions out of the way first.
